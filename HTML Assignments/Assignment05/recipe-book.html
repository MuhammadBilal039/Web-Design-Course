            Take a dough kneading plate and add all-purpose flour to it. Next,
            add salt and baking powder in it and sieve the flour once. Then,
            make a well in the centre and add 2 teaspoon of olive oil to it. On
            the other hand, take a little warm water and mix the yeast in it
            along with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Mix well and keep aside for 10-15
            minutes. The yeast will rise in the meantime. Once the yeast has
            risen, add it to the flour knead the dough nicely using some water.
            Keep this dough aside for 4-6 hours. Then knead the dough once
            again. Now, the pizza dough is ready.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the
            pizza base when the dough is ready. Dust the space a little using
            dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a
            rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make
            sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have made
            the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base
            doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven
            and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the
            onions and cut thin slices of it as well in another bowl. And
            finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However,
            make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the
            veggies are done, Now, grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in
            separate bowls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over.
            Spread half the processed cheese all over the base and evenly put
            the veggies all across the base. Once you have put all the veggies,
            put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven.
            Let the pizza bake 10 minutes at 250 degree Celsius. Once done, take
            out the baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and chilli
            flakes as per your taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that the
            oven is preheated at 250 degree Celsius for 5 minutes at least.)

          <li>
            To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in
            water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4
            cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make
            kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and
            coriander leaves and keep them aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is
            hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black
            cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add
            chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it
            with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic
            paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the
            spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and
            give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry
            before adding it to the dish)
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with
            ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose
            water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is
            tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the
            remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the
            dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due
            to the steam formation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp
            fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with
            raita of your choice. Enjoy!
