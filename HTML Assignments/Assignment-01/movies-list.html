    <p>

      their reunion three years after Rang De Basanti (2006), while Kareena
      Kapoor, Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya appear in pivotal roles. Narrated
      through two parallel dramas, one in the present and the other set ten
      years in the past, the story follows the friendship of three students at
      an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures
      under the Indian education system
    </p>

      Upon its release on 25 December 2009, 3 Idiots received widespread
      critical acclaim with praise directed towards its direction, themes,
      humour, story, screenplay, soundtrack and performances of the cast and was
      a commercial success. It was also the highest-grossing film in its opening
      weekend in India, had the highest opening day collections for an Indian
      film up until that point, and also held the record for the highest net
      collections in the first week for a Hindi film. Eventually, it became one
      of the few Indian films at the time to become successful in East Asian
      markets such as China[15] and Japan, eventually bringing its worldwide
      gross to ₹460 crore ($90 million) — it was the highest-grossing Indian
      film ever at the time until 2013 and the highest grossing Indian film of
      the 2000s.

      Mallah, who is sent by an East India Company official to infiltrate and
      counter a band of thugs
    </p>
    <p>
      Produced at an estimated budget of ₹200 crore (US$29.24 million)–₹300
      crore (US$43.87 million),[10] Thugs of Hindostan is one of the most
      expensive Bollywood films.[11] Initially titled Thug, the film marked the
      first time Khan and Bachchan featured together as leads, and was the
      second collaboration between Khan, Acharya and Kaif, after Dhoom 3 (2013),
      and between Khan and Shaikh after the latter's debut in Khan-produced
      Dangal. Principal photography commenced on 5 June 2017 in Malta; the film
      was also shot in Thailand, Morocco and Mehrangarh. It was put on a short

      India, and the fourth biggest opening weekend in India, but immediately
      experienced a significant drop in the second day itself.[12] The film
      released in China on 28 December 2018, where a special edition edited by
      Aamir Khan was released with a shorter run-time than the original
